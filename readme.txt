Imports and aggregates multiple RSS Feeds using SimplePie. Outputs feeds sorted by date (latest first).

== Description ==

WP RSS Aggregator lets you create a feed reader/aggregator on your WordPress site.

It works in a similar fashion to RSS readers like for example Google Reader. You can add any number of feeds through an administration panel, the plugin will then pull feed items from these sites, merge them and sort them by date.

The plugin uses SimplePie for the feed operations. You can call the function from within your theme or even use a shortcode with parameters.

Since the plugin uses Custom Post Types to store the imported feeds, you are also free to display them in any way you want, in a similar fashion as you would with other post types such as Posts or Pages.

WP RSS Aggregator can also be used to display feed items from a particular feed source anywhere you want on your site.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `wp-rss-aggregator` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the WP RSS Aggregator plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Configure the plugin by going to the `RSS Aggregator` menu item that appears in your dashboard menu.
3. Use the shortcode in your posts or pages: `[wp-rss-aggregator]`

The parameters accepted are:

* links_before
* links_after
* link_before
* link_after
* limit
* source

An example of a shortcode with parameters:
`[wp_rss_aggregator link_before='<li class="feed-link">' link_after='</li>']`
It is advisable to use the 'HTML' view of the editor when inserting the shortcode with paramters.

An example of a function call from within the template files:
`
<?php 
wprss_display_feed_items( $args = array(
'links_before' => '<ul>',
'links_after' => '</ul>',
'link_before' => '<li>',
'link_after' => '</li>',
'limit' => '8',
'source' => '5,9'
)); 
?>
`

OR 

`<?php do_shortcode('[wp-rss-aggregator]'); ?>`

You can also set whether the feed links should open in a new window, current window or even a lightbox, via the settings panel. 

The settings panel also has an option to set links as nofollow for SEO purposes.

Since version 2.0 you can also specify the number of feed items shown on the frontend via the settings panel.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How can I output the feeds in my theme? =

You can either call the function directly within the theme:
`<?php wprss_display_feed_items(); ?>`

Or use the shortcode in your posts and pages:
[wp-rss-aggregator]
